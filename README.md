# MV2

This repository contains the code for my take on (a part of) the [Modelverse](https://msdl.uantwerpen.be/git/yentl/modelverse) for my Master's thesis.

## Development packages

Some packages were used during development, but are not needed for succesful runtime (e.g. linter, autoformatter). These can be found under `requirements_dev.txt`.

## Mandatory packages

Python packages required to succesfully run/test the code in this repository can be found under `requirements.txt`.
